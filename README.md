## README

# Required Files
In order to run the simulation with visualization, the following files must be present in the same folder:
1. DesignImpactSimulator.py
2. pycxsimulator.py
3. pycxsimulator.pyc

To run a Monte Carlo simlation without visualization, only design_agent_MonteCarlo.py is required. 

# Run Instructions
Execute the file DesignImpactSimulator.py and use the GUI to click the "Run" button to run the simulator continuously, or the "Run Once" button to run the simulator for one time step. 

Alternatively, to run the Monte Carlo simulation, execute the file design_agent_MonteCarlo.py. Note that this will produce several text files in the directory the code is housed in, and as such write permissions are required.
